Introduction 
---------------

The following repository is to store code for my Fall Research Project conducted 
as a Florida State University Undergraduate Research Assistant. This research seeks to 
incorporate Local Differential Privacy with Federated Learning and is based off the paper 
"LDP-Fed: Federated Learning with Local Differential Privacy". This research seeks to 
replicate this paper.
